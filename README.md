## 1. Exercise (15 minutes):
  - Choose a form of exercise that you enjoy and can sustain for 15 minutes daily. It could be brisk walking, jogging, yoga, or a quick home workout routine.
    
## 2. Read Self-Help Books:
  - Create a list of self-help books you've been wanting to read. Aim to dedicate a specific time each day to reading, whether it's in the morning, during breaks, or before bed.

## 3. Drink 2 Liters of Water:
  - Stay hydrated by drinking at least 2 liters (or eight 8-ounce glasses) of water each day. Consider carrying a water bottle with you to make it easier to track your intake.

## 4. Coding/Learning (3 Hours):
  - If you're focusing on coding, set specific coding goals for each day. If you're learning a new skill, allocate 3 hours daily for dedicated learning time. Break it down into focused sessions with breaks in between.
