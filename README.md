# 101 Days Challenge
Exercise (15 minutes):

Choose a form of exercise that you enjoy and can sustain for 15 minutes daily. It could be brisk walking, jogging, yoga, or a quick home workout routine.
Read Self-Help Books:

Create a list of self-help books you've been wanting to read. Aim to dedicate a specific time each day to reading, whether it's in the morning, during breaks, or before bed.
Drink 2 Liters of Water:

Stay hydrated by drinking at least 2 liters (or eight 8-ounce glasses) of water each day. Consider carrying a water bottle with you to make it easier to track your intake.
Coding/Learning (3 Hours):

If you're focusing on coding, set specific coding goals for each day. If you're learning a new skill, allocate 3 hours daily for dedicated learning time. Break it down into focused sessions with breaks in between.
Tips for Success:
Create a Schedule:

Plan your day in advance, allocating specific time slots for each of your goals. This helps ensure you have dedicated time for exercise, reading, water intake, and coding/learning.
Track Your Progress:

Use a journal or a digital tracking tool to monitor your daily achievements. This will help you stay motivated and see your progress over the course of the challenge.
Stay Flexible:

Life can be unpredictable. Be open to adjusting your schedule or goals if needed, but aim to maintain consistency overall.
Reward Yourself:

Set up small rewards for reaching milestones within your challenge. Celebrate your achievements to stay motivated throughout the 101 days.
Stay Accountable:

Consider sharing your challenge with a friend or on social media. Having accountability can make it easier to stick to your goals.
Remember that the purpose of the challenge is personal growth and well-being. Adjust the intensity of the challenge as needed to fit your lifestyle, and enjoy the journey! Good luck with your #101DaysChallenge!
